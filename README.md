## 🌟 Why "HZxCzar"?

<div align="center">
  
🏔️ **HZ** + ⚡ **Czar** = 🚀 **HZxCzar**

*From tranquil origins to technological aspirations*

</div>

My username carries personal meaning from two parts of my journey:

### 🏞️ **HZ - My Hometown Roots**

**HZ** represents my hometown - a picturesque place with clear mountains and pristine waters. The slower pace of life there allowed me to experience the simple beauty and authenticity of childhood, shaping my appreciation for both tranquility and depth in everything I pursue.

### ⚔️ **Czar - Strategic Vision and Magic**

**Czar** has dual significance: I was fascinated by the Desert Emperor (Azir) character in League of Legends during my high school years, drawn to the strategic complexity and elegant gameplay mechanics. In Polish, "czar" means "charm" or "magic" - reflecting my belief that there's something magical about the intersection of technology and human creativity.
